    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is also called a probability function or frequency function which characterizes the distribution of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "The most basic difference between probability mass function and probability density function is that probability mass function concentrates on a certain point for example, if we have to find a probability of getting a number 2. Then our whole concentration is on 2. Hence we use pmf however in pdf our concentration our on the interval it is lying."

If we roll two dice simultaneously, there are 36 possible combinations. The probability of rolling ‘1’ (with six possible combinations) again averages to around 16.7%, i.e., (6/36). More the number of dice more elaborate will be the normal distribution graph."

    "Flipping a coin is one of the oldest methods for settling disputes. We all have flipped a coin before a match or game. The perceived fairness in flipping a coin lies in the fact that it has equal chances to come up with either result. The chances of getting a head are 1/2, and the same is for tails. When we add both, it equals one. If we toss coins multiple times, the sum of the probability of getting heads and tails will always remain 1."

A z-score of zero equals the mean. Statisticians also refer to z-scores as standard scores, and I’ll use those terms interchangeably."
